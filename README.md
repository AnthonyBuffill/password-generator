this is my attempt at creating a password generator using javascript.
I used a combination of functions, arrays, and for loops to have the button be pushed by a user followed by a prompt and follow-up questions to run the function that based on the answers supplied by the user.  Once the user completes those tasks, the white box will generate a random password based on the data points provided by the user.

For this challenge I was given no starter javascript code or clues and had to use data found in through research on MDN amongst other community resources.  Thank you for taking the time to view my work and i welcome any feedback on how to make this code more dynamic.
