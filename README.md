this is my attempt at creating a password generator using javascript.
I used a combination of functions, arrays, and for loops to have the button be pushed by a user followed by a prompt and follo-up questions to run the function that based on the answers by the user, will output a raandomly generated password.

For this challenge I was given no starter code or clues to specific code and had to use data found in searches to complete my code
